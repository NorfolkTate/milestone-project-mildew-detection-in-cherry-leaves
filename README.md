## Introduction
This project aims to deliver a dashboard that visually differentiates healthy cherry leaves from those affected by powdery mildew and provides predictions on new leaf images. Using computer vision and machine learning, I have built a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automate the classification process and present the results through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

## Business Requirements
The cherry plantation crop from Farmy & Foods is facing a challenge where their cherry plantations have been presenting powdery mildew. Currently, the process is manual verification if a given cherry tree contains powdery mildew. An employee spends around 30 minutes in each tree, taking a few samples of tree leaves and verifying visually if the leaf tree is healthy or has powdery mildew. If there is powdery mildew, the employee applies a specific compound to kill the fungus. The time spent applying this compound is 1 minute. The company has thousands of cherry trees located on multiple farms across the country. As a result, this manual process is not scalable due to the time spent in the manual process inspection.

To save time in this process, the IT team suggested an ML system that detects instantly, using a leaf tree image, if it is healthy or has powdery mildew. A similar manual process is in place for other crops for detecting pests, and if this initiative is successful, there is a realistic chance to replicate this project for all other crops. The dataset is a collection of cherry leaf images provided by Farmy & Foods, taken from their crops.

- 1 - The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate a healthy cherry leaf from one with powdery mildew.
- 2 - The client is interested in predicting if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew.

## User Stories

The project was developed using Agile methodology. User stories were written to understand and atriculate business requirements and implemented through GitHub Issues and project board (linked to the repo).

## Machine Learning Business Case
Given the image-based nature of the problem, a binary classification model was deemed suitable. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was selected for its proven effectiveness in image classification tasks.

### Performance Goal:
- A target accuracy of 97% was initially discussed. However, due to dataset limitations and model size considerations, this became an aspirational target rather than a strict requirement.

### Business Impact:
- Accurate classification ensures the client avoids supplying compromised products, protecting both reputation and market value.

## Hypothesis

* Hypothesis 1:
The visual characteristics of healthy cherry leaves differ significantly from those affected by powdery mildew and can be quantitatively analyzed.
* Validation: I will use image analysis techniques, such as average images, variability images, and difference plots, to highlight distinguishable features. Image montages will be used for side-by-side comparisons.

Hypothesis 2:
* A convolutional neural network trained on labeled leaf images can classify new leaf samples with up to 97% accuracy.
* Validation: I will evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix. I will compare test results to the target threshold of 97%.

### Rationale to Map Business Requirements to ML Tasks  

The key business requirement is to provide cherry growers with a reliable way of identifying powdery mildew on leaves early, in order to protect yield and reduce unnecessary chemical use. To achieve this, the following mapping between business requirements, ML tasks, and visualisations has been established:  

- **Business Requirement:** Detect whether a cherry leaf is healthy or infected.  
  - **ML Task:** Binary image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
  - **Dashboard Feature:** *Predict Leaf Infection* page, where users upload an image and receive a prediction with confidence score.  

- **Business Requirement:** Provide transparency into how the model performs.  
  - **ML Task:** Model evaluation through accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
  - **Dashboard Feature:** *Model Performance* page, which presents training/validation curves, metrics from `metrics.json`, and a confusion matrix with explanations.  

- **Business Requirement:** Build user trust by allowing exploration of the dataset.  
  - **ML Task:** Not directly ML, but supports ML explainability by showing dataset balance and sample images.  
  - **Dashboard Feature:** *Visualise Dataset* page, where users can explore class balance and random samples to understand what the model was trained on.  

This alignment ensures that machine learning is not only applied (via CNN-based classification) but also directly supports the stated business objectives through interactive dashboard components.  


## Dashboard Design
The dashboard was designed with clarity and business relevance in mind. Pages were structured to address each client requirement and showcase the project workflow. These are demonstrated by the user stories designed for this project and documented on a kanban board.

Key design considerations:
- Simple navigation using Streamlit multipage functionality.
- Clear separation of project overview, findings, predictions, and technical details.
- Allowing non-technical users to interact with the model through file uploads and reports.

## Dataset Content

- The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves). We then created a fictitious user story where predictive analytics can be applied in a real project in the workplace.
- The dataset contains +4 thousand images taken from the client's crop fields. The images show healthy cherry leaves and cherry leaves that have powdery mildew, a fungal disease that affects many plant species. The cherry plantation crop is one of the finest products in their portfolio, and the company is concerned about supplying the market with a compromised quality product.

## Known Bugs and Limitations

During development, a number of challenges and limitations were encountered:  

- **Container width**: Fixed by adding `use_container_width=True`.  
- **Undefined `probs`**: Solved by setting it to `None` (seems to be a Streamlit quirk).  
- **Image size mismatch**: Standardised uploads to (256, 256, 3).  
- **Indentation errors**: Python being picky â€” fixed as I tested.  
- **Forgot to save before commits**: A few messy commit messages because of this - see,s to be a VS code fave 
- **Library imports**: Sometimes repeated across notebooks. Didnâ€™t break anything, just untidy.  
- **Data splitting**: Tried a few methods before sticking with a consistent approach.  
- **TensorFlow install**: Wouldnâ€™t install on Windows until I enabled long paths in VS Code.  
- **Repo confusion**: VS Code sometimes reopened an old repo.  
- **Pip vs !pip**: Got caught out a couple of times switching between terminal and notebooks.  
- **Spelling mistakes**: e.g., *normalize* vs *normalise*.  
- **Model saving**: Started with `.h5`, moved to Kerasâ€™ native format for stability.  
- **Large files**: Accidentally committed some, later fixed with `.gitignore`

These challenges provided valuable (if sometimes frusrtating) learning opportunities and do not prevent the app from functioning 


## Further Improvements

There are several areas where this project could be extended or improved in the future:
- **Data Augmentation:** Apply techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming to increase dataset variability and reduce overfitting.
- **Larger Models:** Experiment with more advanced architectures such as ResNet or EfficientNet to potentially improve accuracy.
- **Additional Crops:** Extend the model to detect powdery mildew (or other diseases) in crops beyond cherries, making it more useful to Farmy & Foods.
- **Mobile Deployment:** Develop a lightweight mobile version of the model so farmers can take photos of leaves in the field and receive instant predictions.


## Conclusion
This project set out to build a system capable of distinguishing between healthy cherry leaves and those infected with powdery mildew. By training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the provided dataset, the model achieved a high level of accuracy, correctly classifying most test images.  

The results show that the model is effective at addressing the clientâ€™s main requirement: reducing the need for manual inspection and saving time across large cherry plantations. While the model is not perfect and may benefit from more training data or augmentation, it demonstrates that predictive analytics can be successfully applied to this agricultural challenge.  

In summary, the machine learning pipeline was successful in meeting the project goals, and it provides a strong foundation for further development and deployment
